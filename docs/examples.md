# Examples
The configuration of the scripts can be assigned via terminal commands or written in a file with the same name as the script to be executed with extension .cfg. The parameters that were not sent have their values assigned to default. **Case some terminal command is sent jointly with the execution of the script, the entire configuration of the simulation will be done by the terminal commands, thus, the .cfg file will be ignored and any parameter that was not sent via terminal will have its default value assigned.** If no parameter is sent via terminal, the script will search for a file with the same name as the script with extension .cfg (more details in [Configuration files .CFG](https://github.com/Leonardo-Viana/Reinforcement-Learning/edit/master/docs/cfg.md)). If neither of the options listed above is used, the agent will be trained with all the values assigned as default. In other words, it will be used the hyperparameters shown in the article [XXX] for the training of an agent in the game Pong. For more information about each of the configurable parameters available and their default values see the [Documentation-parameters] section or use the following command in the terminal:
