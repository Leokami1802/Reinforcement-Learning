# Configuration files .CFG
The files with extension .cfg are files that have configurations to the execution of the reinforcement learning algorithm. These files are an alternative that facilitates the execution and debug of the training/testing of the agents in the chosen environments. Instead of type long codes in the terminal in combination with execution of the script, we write these configurations in the file .cfg that have the same name as the script to be executed, for example, Base_agent.cfg for the script Base_agent.py. Under the hood, what the script does is to read the cfg file and transform each valid line of code in terminal commands that, once converted, are sent to Argparser before initialization. Hence, one line of code env = Doom is converted in --env Doom and is sent to the main method of the executed script. An important fact to watch in the cfg files is that: **Case some terminal command is sent jointly with the execution of the script, the entire configuration of the simulation will be done by the terminal commands, thus, any parameter that is not sent will have its default value assigned.**
